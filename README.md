# yelp-camp

Yelp Camp is a fun application that allows you to view campgrounds with a short description. Once you login or signup you can begin to create your own campgrounds that includes a title, image address and short description.

YelpCamp is a more complex application built from scratch using the following technologies:

On the front-end I have used HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap for responsive layout, and jQuery. On the back-end I used NodeJS, NPM, ExpressJS, REST, 
Authentication, Authorization and PassportJS. For datastore I used non-sql MongoDB. The application was developed on Cloud9 IDE and source versioned with GIT.
